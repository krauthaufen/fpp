# Known issues

One directory, one file per open bug, each the SMALLEST program that still
shows it. They are not part of any gate — a gate that is allowed to fail
teaches nothing — but every one of them is a real, reproducible defect, and
the diagnosis at the top of the file is what the next person needs.

Run one with:

```bash
dotnet run -c Release --project src/Fpp.Cli -- build -o /tmp/x.wasm \
    tests/known-issues/<name>.fpp
~/.wasmtime/bin/wasmtime run -W gc=y,exceptions=y /tmp/x.wasm
```

* `tuple-value-occurs-check.fpp` — a tuple of two pattern binders inside a
  loop reports an occurs check. The last thing between the port and the end
  of `IndexList.fs`, and the one open bug here that resists reduction.
