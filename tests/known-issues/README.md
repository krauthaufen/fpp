# Known issues

One directory, one file per open bug, each the SMALLEST program that still
shows it. They are not part of any gate — a gate that is allowed to fail
teaches nothing — but every one of them is a real, reproducible defect, and
the diagnosis at the top of the file is what the next person needs.

Run one with:

```bash
dotnet run -c Release --project src/Fpp.Cli -- build -o /tmp/x.wasm \
    tests/known-issues/<name>.fpp
~/.wasmtime/bin/wasmtime run -W gc=y,exceptions=y /tmp/x.wasm
```

* `let-rec-and-group-self-host.fpp` — a `let rec ... and` group inside the
  `lower` function miscompiles under SELF-HOST only. Not reproduced in
  isolation; the note records exactly what was ruled out.

* `byref-cell-by-hand.fpp` — a `ByRefCell` written by hand traps, while
  every compiler-synthesized one works. It is what blocks `ref`, which the
  library uses.
